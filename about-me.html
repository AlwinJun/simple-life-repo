              <strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. Things were
              terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

            <p class="article-body">
              <strong> I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment,
              and I quit my job.
            </p>
            <p class="article-body">It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>

            <p class="article-body">Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
            <p class="article-body">
              With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well,
              which is why I started this site!
